# Automated Response — Security & Incident Response Addendum

## Purpose

This addendum addresses advanced security considerations for the automated incident response module, organized by topic area. It complements the main [Automated Response Guide](automated-response-guide.md) with depth required for enterprise security reviews, compliance assessments, and incident response planning.

## 1. ONTAP Protocol & Security Style Considerations

### Volume Security Style Impact on SMB Blocking

The name-mapping blocking mechanism works across ALL volume security styles:

| Volume Security Style | SMB Block Effective? | Why |
|----------------------|---------------------|-----|
| `ntfs` | ✅ Yes | ONTAP performs SID-to-UNIX translation for internal tracking even on NTFS volumes |
| `unix` | ✅ Yes | SMB access requires UNIX identity resolution through name-mapping |

> **Note on `mixed` security style**: The `mixed` security style is not recommended for new deployments. NetApp best practice is to explicitly choose `ntfs` (Windows-only workloads) or `unix` (Linux/NFS-primary workloads). For multiprotocol access, use `ntfs` with appropriate name-mapping, or `unix` with AD integration. The SMB blocking mechanism via name-mapping is effective regardless of which recommended style is in use.

> **ONTAP internals**: Name-mapping (win-to-unix) is evaluated during session setup and file access for ALL security styles. Blocking via empty replacement (`" "`) causes the translation to fail, which denies SMB access regardless of the volume's security style.

### NFS Authentication Method Impact on IP Blocking

| NFS Auth Method | IP-Based Block Effective? | Notes |
|----------------|--------------------------|-------|
| AUTH_SYS (most common) | ✅ Yes | Client identified by IP; export-policy rule blocks by IP |
| Kerberos (krb5/krb5i/krb5p) | ⚠️ Partial | Client authenticated by principal; same principal from different IP bypasses IP block |
| AUTH_NONE | ✅ Yes | Client identified by IP |

For Kerberos NFS environments, complement IP blocking with:
- Network-level controls (Security Group, NACL)
- Kerberos principal revocation (AD account disable)
- Export-policy rule blocking the Kerberos-authenticated client's IP range

### Multi-Protocol Threat Containment

For volumes accessed via BOTH NFS and SMB (multiprotocol), execute both containment actions:

```json
// Message 1: Block SMB
{"action": "contain_smb_threat", "svm_name": "svm-prod", "domain": "CORP", "username": "jdoe", "volume_name": "vol_data"}

// Message 2: Block NFS (same user's workstation IP)
{"action": "contain_nfs_threat", "svm_name": "svm-prod", "client_ip": "10.0.5.99", "volume_name": "vol_data"}
```

> **Architecture consideration**: A future `contain_multiprotocol_threat` composite action could combine both in a single message. Currently, publish two messages to achieve full multi-protocol containment.

## 2. Evidence Preservation & Forensics

### Snapshot Tamper Protection

Standard snapshots can be deleted by volume administrators. For forensic-grade evidence:

| Protection Level | Mechanism | ONTAP Version | Recommendation |
|-----------------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Basic | Normal snapshot (current implementation) | Any | Acceptable for operational response |
| Enhanced | Snapshot locking (`snapshot lock create`) | 9.12.1+ | Recommended for regulated environments |
| Maximum | SnapLock Compliance volume | 9.10.1+ | Required for legal-hold scenarios |

> **FSx for ONTAP**: Snapshot locking is supported. After creating the protective snapshot, optionally lock it:
> ```
> POST /api/storage/volumes/{uuid}/snapshots/{snapshot_uuid}
> Body: {"retention_period": "P30D"}  // ISO 8601 duration — lock for 30 days
> ```

### Chain of Custody Requirements (DFIR)

For forensically-valid evidence, the response action should capture:

| Element | Current Status | Enhancement Path |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Trigger source (who requested) | ✅ In CloudWatch Logs (SNS message body) | — |
| Exact timestamp (UTC) | ✅ In CloudWatch Logs + snapshot metadata | — |
| Pre-action state | ⚠️ Not captured | Future: query name-mapping/export-policy before modifying |
| Post-action state | ✅ API response confirms creation | — |
| Lambda execution identity | ✅ In CloudWatch Logs (requestId) | — |
| Trigger message hash | ❌ Not implemented | Future: SHA-256 of SNS message in log entry |

### Snapshot Retention Policy

For sustained incidents generating multiple snapshots:
- Retain `incident_response_*` snapshots for 30 days (configurable)
- After 30 days: migrate to AWS Backup (long-term) or delete
- Monitor snapshot space consumption via CloudWatch metric `StorageCapacity`
- Alert if incident snapshots consume > 10% of volume capacity

## 3. FPolicy: Preventive vs Reactive Control

This project implements **reactive** containment (detect → block after the fact). FPolicy offers an additional **preventive** mode:

| Aspect | FPolicy Passthrough (this project) | FPolicy Mandatory | Automated Response (this module) |
|--------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| Timing | After operation completes | Before operation completes | After detection + analysis |
| Latency | 0ms (logging only) | +1-5ms per file operation | ~65s (detection + response) |
| Can prevent damage | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (deny operation) | ❌ No (blocks future operations) |
| False positive impact | None (logging) | High (blocks legitimate files) | Medium (blocks entire user) |
| Complexity | Low | High (external server decision logic) | Medium |

> **Defense-in-depth**: Use FPolicy mandatory mode for known-bad patterns (block `.encrypted` file creation), and automated response for behavioral anomalies (block user after mass deletion pattern detected).

## 4. Insider Threat & System Integrity

### Threat Model: Compromised Administrator

If an attacker gains access to:

| Compromised Component | Impact | Mitigation |
|----------------------|--------|------------|
| ONTAP fsxadmin credentials | Can unblock self, delete snapshots | Use ONTAP RBAC: create a `response_blocker` role with write-only access to name-mapping (no delete permission) |
| AWS Secrets Manager | Same as above | IAM policy: restrict Secrets Manager access to the Lambda execution role only |
| SNS trigger topic | Can send unblock messages | SNS access policy: restrict `unblock_*` actions to specific IAM principals |
| Lambda code / CloudFormation | Can modify response logic | CloudTrail alerts on stack/function modifications |
| CloudWatch Logs | Can delete audit trail | Export logs to S3 with Object Lock (WORM) |

### Authorization Separation Pattern

For high-security environments, separate block and unblock credentials:

```
Block Lambda: Uses ONTAP user "response_blocker" 
  - Permissions: name-mapping create, export-policy rule create, snapshot create
  - Cannot: name-mapping delete, export-policy rule delete

Unblock Lambda: Uses ONTAP user "response_admin" (separate secret)
  - Permissions: name-mapping delete, export-policy rule delete
  - Requires: additional IAM gate (separate SNS topic with approval workflow)
```

### SNS Topic Access Policy (Restrict Unblock)

```json
{
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Deny",
    "Principal": "*",
    "Action": "SNS:Publish",
    "Resource": "<trigger-topic-arn>",
    "Condition": {
      "StringLike": {"aws:PrincipalArn": "arn:aws:iam::*:role/non-security-*"},
      "ForAnyValue:StringEquals": {"sns:MessageBody": ["unblock_smb_user", "unblock_nfs_ip"]}
    }
  }]
}
```

> Note: SNS condition on message body requires custom validation. For strict control, use a separate SNS topic for unblock actions.

## 5. DR & Replication Considerations

### SnapMirror Replication Behavior

| Item | Replicated to DR? | Implication |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| Name-mapping entries | ❌ No | Blocked user regains access after failover |
| Export-policy rules | ✅ Yes | IP block persists after failover |
| Incident response snapshots | ✅ Yes (if in SnapMirror scope) | Evidence preserved at DR site |
| ARP state | ❌ No (resets on DR) | ARP needs learning period at DR site |

**DR-Aware Blocking Procedure**:
1. Block on primary SVM (normal operation)
2. ALSO block on DR SVM (publish second message to DR endpoint)
3. After failover, verify blocks are active on the now-primary DR SVM

For automated dual-site blocking, maintain two CloudFormation stacks (primary + DR) with separate ONTAP management IPs.

## 6. Container & Dynamic Environments

### Kubernetes / ECS Considerations

IP-based NFS blocking is less effective in containerized environments because:
- Pod IPs are ephemeral (new pod = new IP = bypasses block)
- Multiple pods share the same node IP for NFS traffic (blocking the node blocks ALL pods)

**Recommendations for containerized workloads**:

| Approach | Effectiveness | Complexity |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| Block node IP range (subnet) | ✅ High (blocks all pods on node) | Low |
| PersistentVolume access mode restriction | ✅ High (unmount at K8s level) | Medium |
| NetworkPolicy (K8s) | ✅ High (block pod→FSx traffic) | Medium |
| Service Account → ONTAP user mapping | ✅ Precise | High (requires custom mapping) |

---

## 7. Governance & Compliance

### FISC Guidelines (日本金融業界)

| FISC Requirement | How This System Addresses It |
|-----------------|------------------------------|
| Pre-approval of automated response policies | Document policies, get security officer sign-off before enabling |
| Annual review of response rules | Review `PROTECTED_ACCOUNTS`, detection thresholds, TTL settings annually |
| Quarterly testing of response mechanisms | Use `health_check` action + safe block/unblock cycle on test SVM |
| Documented escalation path | `pagerduty-escalation-guide.md` + notification topic → on-call |

### GDPR Article 22 Consideration

Automated blocking affects an individual's ability to perform their job. Under GDPR Article 22:
- Automated decisions with significant effects require human review
- **Recommendation**: For EU employee populations, implement a mandatory human review within 1 hour of automated blocking
- The TTL auto-unblock (default: 60 min) serves as a safety net
- Document the lawful basis for automated blocking (legitimate interest: preventing data breach)

### SOC2 CC7.3 — Post-Action Review

Every automated response action should be:
1. ✅ Triggered by legitimate detection (audit trail in CloudWatch Logs)
2. ⚠️ Proportionate to threat (configurable — use severity field)
3. ⚠️ Reviewed by qualified personnel post-facto (requires process, not just tooling)
4. ✅ Reversed when no longer needed (TTL auto-unblock or manual unblock)

**Recommendation**: Create a daily/weekly review cadence where security team reviews all `contain_*` actions from the notification topic.

## 8. SOAR Platform Integration

### Supported Operations for SOAR Playbooks

| Operation | SNS Action | Returns | Use in SOAR |
|-----------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Block user | `block_smb_user` | Confirmation | Response step |
| Block IP | `block_nfs_ip` | Confirmation | Response step |
| Full containment | `contain_smb_threat` | Multi-step result | Composite response |
| Check status | `list_active_blocks` | Current blocks | Enrichment step |
| Health check | `health_check` | Connectivity status | Health monitoring |
| Unblock | `unblock_smb_user` | Confirmation | Recovery step |

### Idempotency

- `block_smb_user`: NOT idempotent (creates duplicate entries if called twice). SOAR should check `list_active_blocks` first.
- `block_nfs_ip`: NOT idempotent (creates duplicate rules). Check first.
- `create_snapshot`: Idempotent via cooldown (skips if recent snapshot exists).
- `health_check`: Idempotent (read-only).
- `list_active_blocks`: Idempotent (read-only).

## 9. Cloud-Agnostic Usage

The `OntapResponseClient` Python class is cloud-agnostic. It requires only:
- Network access to ONTAP management IP (TCP 443)
- ONTAP admin credentials
- Python 3.9+ with `urllib3`

It can be invoked from:
- AWS Lambda (this project's deployment pattern)
- Azure Functions
- GCP Cloud Functions
- On-premises Python scripts
- SOAR platform custom integrations (XSOAR, Splunk SOAR)
- CI/CD pipelines (GitLab CI, GitHub Actions)
- Any environment with Python + network access

The SNS/Lambda/CloudFormation wrapping is the AWS-native deployment pattern — the core containment logic is portable.

## 10. Rate Limits & Scalability

### ONTAP Management Plane Limits

| Metric | Approximate Limit | Impact |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| REST API requests/sec | ~100 req/s (FSx for ONTAP) | Mass-blocking (20+ users) may need queuing |
| Concurrent CIFS sessions | Thousands | Session disconnect at scale is sequential |
| Name-mapping entries per SVM | 256 | Hard limit on simultaneous SMB blocks |
| Export-policy rules per policy | 1024 | Sufficient for most scenarios |

**For mass-blocking scenarios**: Implement SQS buffering between detection and the response Lambda to rate-limit ONTAP API calls.
